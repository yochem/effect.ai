# SubtAI - AI powered subtitling

This project converts a JSON speech-to-text file to a fully functional SRT
subtitle file. This SRT file consists of caption groups with if needed, line
breaks according to the [subtitle guidelines of the
BBC](https://bbc.github.io/subtitle-guidelines/#Break-at-natural-points).

## Features

This project mainly generates proper formatted caption groups given a
transcript with word-timing. It implements the following rules from the BBC
guide mentioned above:

- Part-of-Speech tags
- Punctuation
- Gaps in speech
- Character limit (< 84)
- Line limit (< 42)
- And more to come!
