Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:08,360
we build a lot of high performance computers around here,

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,550
but today is going to be different.

6
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,560
We scoured the Internet for the slowest brand new components that money can buy,

7
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:21,050
and we're gonna build it right here right now.

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,780
Then for comparison.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:36,050
We also grab some sort of what I would consider to be budget components but sensible ones to see just how much more performance you can get if you balance your budget,

10
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:39,250
it's really the packaging for that.

11
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,160
We're gonna get to that bit later,

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,490
though.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,350
