1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,093
- Nature.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,340
- [Man] Tasty, oh my God.

3
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,890
Spit that out James.

4
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,660
You, no you didn't.

5
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,210
- I'm a vegetarian mother (beep).

6
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:12,480
- Valve has given developers
access to the beta

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,340
for Steam Cloud Play.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,150
It's unclear exactly what
those new services will

9
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,240
look like for consumers,
but here's what we know.

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,700
Steam cloud play can
apparently integrate cloud

11
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,880
streaming services into
your Steam library.

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,190
Allowing you to launch
services like GeForce Now

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:26,730
from Steam.

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,210
Okay, but why would you
want to do that instead

15
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,770
of just using GeForce Now regularly

16
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,230
or streaming from your own
PC using Steam roleplay?

17
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,110
Well the key difference
here seems to be that

18
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,390
Steam Cloud Play could
involve streaming games,

19
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,750
not from your own PC or in video servers,

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,200
but from servers hosted by Valve.

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,070
Why do I care?

22
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,160
It also looks like Steam
Cloud Play integration

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,360
could help services
like GeForce Now expand

24
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,670
their library of supported
games, that would be nice.

25
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,160
If it's super easy for
publishers to opt in via

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,010
Steam platform.

27
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,930
The news comes just as GeForce
Now is actually getting

28
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,380
some triple A games from
Ubisoft back on the platfrom

29
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,930
through the Epic Games store.

30
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,780
But lets be real hey guys, no
one owns those games on EGS.

31
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,463
We all just claim the free games.

32
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,176
Thank you Fortnite.

33
00:01:11,176 --> 00:01:12,230
- [Man] We're not gonna buy
it, if we don't have to.

34
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,350
- Okay, we're gonna talk about Trump

35
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,760
and Twitter now, okay?

36
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,840
But you gotta keep it chill okay.

37
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,981
Lets all just

38
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,000
(breathing in)

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,080
This week has seen a tense confrontation

40
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,540
between Twitter and U.S
President Donald Trump,

41
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,290
over a number of his tweets.

42
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,320
It started on Tuesday when Twitter pinned

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,220
a fact checking-link to
one of Trump's tweets.

44
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,540
In which he claimed that Mail-In Ballots

45
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,240
will lead to election fraud.

46
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,200
Then on Thursday, Trump
signed an executive order

47
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,700
directing the FCC and FTC to investigate

48
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
whether new regulations could be placed

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,550
on social media giants
like Twitter and Facebook,

50
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,140
which would effectively
turn them into publishers,

51
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,150
which are liable and could
be sued for the content

52
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,470
they host, instead of merely platforms,

53
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,720
which are not liable for said content.

54
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,730
Currently, Twitter and
Facebook are protected

55
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,920
from liability by section 230 of the

56
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,440
communications indecency act.

57
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,070
There's plants in my mouth.

58
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,030
Which both Trump and Joe
Biden want to overturn.

59
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,960
It's unclear what an order like this would

60
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,030
accomplish for Trump as Twitter
might be more incentivized

61
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,060
to remove sensitive tweets

62
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,550
if they are liable for
hosting certain content.

63
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,760
Which is the very thing that prompted

64
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,336
this whole debacle in the first place!

65
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:17,420
- [Man] How Ironic!

66
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,253
- I don't get it.

67
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:20,100
While Twitter is going head
to head with the president,

68
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,490
Mark Zukerburg apparently
wants to just stay out of it.

69
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,950
Robots they don't like drama,

70
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:28,610
Zuckerburg said in an
interview that Facebook

71
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,160
shouldn't be the arbiter of truth,

72
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,580
even though the platform has been

73
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,720
fact-checking posts about
the American election

74
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,510
and the COVID-19 pandemic.

75
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,860
We'll have to wait and see what the future

76
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,130
of social media looks like
but on the bright side,

77
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,431
at least you can now schedule
tweets on desktop again.

78
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,264
- [Man] Yay!

79
00:02:42,264 --> 00:02:43,432
- Again, not now.

80
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:44,441
- [Man] Later.

81
00:02:44,441 --> 00:02:46,180
- Yeah in the future.

82
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,013
- [Man] Yeah.

83
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:47,846
- Now for some lighter news;

84
00:02:47,846 --> 00:02:50,700
HP has unveiled the reverb G2 headset

85
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,849
for desktop powered VR
and it might have just

86
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:56,390
knocked the index out of
the best VR headset thrown.

87
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,920
It's 599 US with a per eye resolution

88
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,590
of 2160 by 2160 that's a square.

89
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,270
The index panels are just 1440 P.

90
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,170
Its got 9 gigahertz refresh rate,

91
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,970
and a field of view around 114 degrees.

92
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,110
Although, field of view is dependent upon

93
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,340
a number of factors so it's hard

94
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,100
to describe with a single number.

95
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,125
Riley, everybody knows that.

96
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:16,958
(man laughing)

97
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:18,296
But Valve apparently isn't scared of the

98
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:20,020
headset's success, they actually worked

99
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,930
with HP to develop it and you can see that

100
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,430
in the G2's speakers.

101
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,910
Which look like they were
taken right off an index.

102
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,640
Microsoft also helped HP.

103
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,050
They developed the units new windows

104
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,660
mixed reality controllers,
which come with the headset.

105
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,050
The Reverb G2 uses insight to tracking,

106
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,310
no base station is required.

107
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,780
So we'll have to see whether Linux looks

108
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,620
just as silly playing Beat Saber

109
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,330
wearing this thing instead of the index.

110
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,230
Now its time for the quick pit,

111
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,690
brought to you by XSplit Vcam.

112
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:45,600
All the letters

113
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,120
It can remove, replace, and blur your

114
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,990
screening background
without a green screen.

115
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,550
And it works with any
web cam dammit any one!

116
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,890
So there's no need for
complicated lighting setups.

117
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,680
This isn't film school, its
the internet gosh darn it!

118
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,930
You can customize the
background to anything you want.

119
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,120
And it works with other broadcast tools,

120
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,770
and even messaging apps
like Slack, Hang out, Skype,

121
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,603
and more.

122
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:07,340
XSplit promises 24/7 support
and life time updates

123
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,570
for as little as 3995
for a life time license

124
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,950
or 995 for a three months.

125
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,040
That's three bucks a month,

126
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,870
that's like a coffee or a flapjack.

127
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,840
You can also use code
LINUSTECHTIPS to get 10% off,

128
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,930
so do that at the link below.

129
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,940
This is like free

130
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,280
in America.

131
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,424
Quick base,

132
00:04:26,424 --> 00:04:27,257
(clearing throat)

133
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:28,090
What's up.

134
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,820
Hey, did you buy this
$370 dollar USB stick

135
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,653
that promises

136
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,890
to protect you from 5G radiation?

137
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,000
Well I'm sorry, you're an idiot.

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
No refunds.

139
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,019
You see, it doesn't actually use quantam

140
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:40,890
hollographic catalyzer technology

141
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,190
for the balance and harmonization
of the harmful effects

142
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:46,090
of imbalance electrical radiation at all.

143
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,543
It doesn't do anything,
because its a 128 megabyte

144
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:54,610
USB key with a sticker on
it and you should've known.

145
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:58,260
Shame on you and your country
which poorly educated you.

146
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,690
And the companies in your country

147
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,000
that let you be in a filter bubble.

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,020
Samsung had officially
unveiled a new version

149
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,460
of the Galaxy Book S,

150
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,710
featuring an intel lake-field processor

151
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,070
instead of the qualicom 8CX arm chipset.

152
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,110
If it's good, the first lake-field laptop

153
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,870
could prove arm doesn't have a future

154
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,750
of fit in lights after all.

155
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,730
And intel really needs a wedge right now,

156
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,240
so come on guys, look into your hearts.

157
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,320
I think I saw them last
night outside a bar,

158
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,760
just sitting on the curb
crying into their Budweiser,

159
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,060
And they're not supposed to
bring the glasses outside.

160
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,318
Nvidia has launched Quadro Experience.

161
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:35,080
A Windows app that fulfills
many of the same functions

162
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,990
for PC's running Quadro graphers cards

163
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,600
as the GeForce Experience
app does for systems

164
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,190
with gaming folk as GeForce cards.

165
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,590
So I guess you're not
gonna download it either.

166
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,220
You just can record 4K
footage, get driver updates,

167
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,660
and optimize games.

168
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,630
But don't forget, you can
run games on a Quadro too.

169
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,495
You are just if you do that
well, you're just spending

170
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:56,240
a lot more to do that.

171
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,810
Russians, that's how Hilary Clinton says,

172
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,370
the Russians are hacking our emails.

173
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,270
The NSA says a division
of the Russian Military

174
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,420
code named Sandworm, very dune,

175
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,510
has been attacking email servers that run

176
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,020
the extra mail transfer agent.

177
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,853
Its an agent.

178
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:13,530
Which is used in both private
and Government organizations.

179
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,350
Hopefully, this naming and
shaming will get IT managers

180
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,440
to issue purchase but you know,

181
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,320
the most effective way to kill a sandworm?

182
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,153
- [Man's voice] What is it?

183
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:23,070
- It's a spoilers

184
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,807
- [Man's voice] I thought
you would know dun!

185
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:25,690
How do you kill them?

186
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,721
- I can't even respond
to that without spoilers.

187
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,554
- [Man] Jeeez!

188
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:32,440
- And an app by Yamaha,
called Remote Cheerer,

189
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,290
will let sports fans
who are watching matches

190
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,220
from home to connect to giant speakers

191
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,110
in the stadium so they can
cheer on their teams from a far.

192
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,420
But the players won't
hear your actual voice.

193
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,290
Fans will choose from a preset selection

194
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,500
of cheers, boos, and rhythmic claps.

195
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,290
That's probably for the best.

196
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,650
I host chances this is a recipe

197
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,340
for the biggest zoom bomb ever.

198
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,630
This is so stupid,

199
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,533
- [Man] Come on ref, ooooh!

200
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:56,860
- Like if there's not a good turn out

201
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,870
then people in the sound board,

202
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,500
are just like turn it up anyway.

203
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,890
- [Man] They are like the cheering is on.

204
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,130
- They really like you.

205
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,280
That's enough of this nonsense,

206
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,850
come back on Monday for more Tech news

207
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,520
and maybe we'll have a building.

208
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,766
Will have to survive on plants!

209
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,610
- [Man] Don't do it James.

210
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,700
How do you feel?

211
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,590
- I'm good, prickly leaf exclusive.

212
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,253
This is actually the best leaf I've eaten.
