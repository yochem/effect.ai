00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,910
- Thanks to LastPass for
sponsoring a portion of this video.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,100
More from them later.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,260
Ladies and gentlemen, we build a lot

4
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,390
of high-performance computers around here,

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,050
but today is gonna be different.

6
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:12,780
We scoured the Internet

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:17,670
for the slowest brand new
components that money can buy,

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,490
and we're gonna build it
right here, right now.

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,230
Then for comparison, we also grabbed some

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,490
sort of what I would consider
to be budget components,

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,430
but sensible ones,

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,850
to see just how much more
performance you can get

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,223
if you balance your budget.

14
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,060
Is that really the packaging for that?

15
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,710
We're gonna get to that
a bit later, though.

16
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,250
First, don't worry, the
parts aren't in there.

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,100
It's already built.

18
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,359
Let's roll that intro, tsk.

19
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:50,942
(upbeat music)

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,950
Of course, my expectations
may end up being subverted,

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:03,393
and our slowest possible computer,

22
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,662
where's the CPU?

23
00:01:06,662 --> 00:01:07,660
(beeping)

24
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,180
Maybe this will end up being
an amazing bang for the buck,

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:13,620
starting with our AMD Athlon 3000G.

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:18,620
So this puppy right here is
a 3.5 gigahertz dual core.

27
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,260
That's not real impressive for 2020.

28
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,530
And making matters worse,

29
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,330
this is based on AMD's
older Zen architecture

30
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:27,300
rather than Zen 2.

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:32,300
But hey, for $55, plus it
actually includes a cooler,

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,560
I guess, you know, it's hard to really,

33
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,602
it's hard to really complain,

34
00:01:37,602 --> 00:01:39,403
like how is the CPU $50?

35
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:44,920
For our motherboard, we've
gone with MSI's A320M-A PRO.

36
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,040
So this is about as entry level as it gets

37
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,360
for an AM4 motherboard.

38
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,930
You've got just two DIMM slots,

39
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,170
although that will be enough
for us to run dual channel,

40
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,530
assuming that our budget allows it,

41
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,770
which it doesn't 'cause we're building

42
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,890
the slowest possible computer.

43
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,000
It has a PCI-Express 16X
Gen3 graphics card slot.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,850
We will be installing a graphics card.

45
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,060
And then you've got onboard video

46
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,300
in case you wanna use an APU.

47
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,700
Wow!

48
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,533
Are those PS2 ports?

49
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:10,730
Dang!

50
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,750
No NVMe for us today, folks.

51
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,433
We're not even using an SSD.

52
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,170
Man, it feels like this should
contribute to it being slow,

53
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,890
but honestly, with just two cores,

54
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,513
I'm expecting this to do a
pretty decent job of cooling.

55
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,061
I feel like I should clarify
that the parts that we picked

56
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:33,790
were not necessarily the
slowest ones that we could find,

57
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,540
but rather that we limited ourselves

58
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,600
to things that are
currently in production.

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,530
So the slowest, brand new,

60
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,710
and technically modern
parts that you can build.

61
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,620
Naturally, no slowest possible build

62
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,010
would be complete without a
single stick of DDR4 memory.

63
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,590
The CPU does have a
dual-channel memory controller,

64
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:56,430
but, I mean, if we're
looking for the bare minimum

65
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,150
to fire up the machine and
get into Windows, tsk, tsk,

66
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,581
four gigs of RAM,

67
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:02,230
that's it.

68
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:04,210
Wow, you sure can build a computer quickly

69
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,410
when there's not much in it.

70
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,820
We're like halfway there already.

71
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,210
Between our CPU, motherboard,
and RAM, we've spent $125.

72
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:17,850
That's less than like
a gaming motherboard.

73
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,540
But while you guys might think
that I'm impressed by that,

74
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,720
I'm actually kinda
worried for the prospects

75
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,570
of our slowest possible computer here,

76
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:31,380
because CPU, RAM, and motherboard
on the secondhand market,

77
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,420
hoo-wee, lemme tell ya!

78
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,420
I could get some better stuff than that.

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,900
You know, that's what
kinda drives me crazy

80
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,790
about this entry-level
hardware, as it gets branded.

81
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:46,970
Really what it is, is in my
opinion, basically E-waste.

82
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,750
Because you might say, well you know,

83
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,490
not everyone wants to put the work in

84
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,710
to putting together something secondhand.

85
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:55,890
But it's not even a ton of work.

86
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,510
I mean, we did that video recently

87
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,440
where we took an old Dell Optiplex,

88
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,560
basically threw a graphics card in it

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,200
for less than what we're gonna spend

90
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,650
on this complete brand-new machine,

91
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,530
and lemme tell ya, spoiler alert,

92
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:13,120
this thing is gonna run,

93
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,650
what's the opposite of running
circles around something?

94
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,110
For our case, we've got a Thermaltake H17,

95
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,180
which at the time, was priced the same

96
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,010
as the DeepCool MATREXX that
we had originally chosen.

97
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,800
So, $35.

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,540
Point is, that's about
the cheapest you can get

99
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,180
unless it's on fire sale for
a brand new computer case.

100
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,850
And then for our power supply
we've got a Corsair CV550.

101
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,410
This is your entry level,

102
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,260
hey, I don't want my computer to blow up,

103
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,660
that would be a bad
thing, kinda power supply.

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:43,420
You can get power supplies
for $13 or whatever,

105
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,870
but even on a system like
this I would not recommend

106
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,703
plugging them in.

107
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:49,689
I mean, what's the point of ruining stuff?

108
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:50,695
Oh!

109
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,530
Four whole screws to
put in the power supply.

110
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,363
Jeepers.

111
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:55,920
(panting)

112
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,523
Just need to, oh, rehydrate.

113
00:04:59,371 --> 00:05:00,613
(laughs) lttstore.com.

114
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,620
So this is cool.

115
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,190
Kind of like an SSD except
just with some rubber grommets

116
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,720
to just mount your hard drive like that.

117
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,950
Should I put in all the screws?

118
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,970
I mean, there's really
not that many of them.

119
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,270
We had a second fan

120
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,000
that we intended to install on this puppy,

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,580
but I don't think we're
gonna be doing that

122
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,250
because there is only a single fan header

123
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,560
aside from the CPU fan
header on this motherboard.

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,730
More simplicity.

125
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,563
Boom!

126
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,590
Fan installed, cable managed.

127
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,870
This is actually pretty
nice for a budget case.

128
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,660
Hey, wow, we've got USB 3

129
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,300
on both our case and motherboard.

130
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,100
I'm gonna show you guys a little trick.

131
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,040
You can just take all of
these little individual pieces

132
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:46,600
and kinda make your own
block of connectors.

133
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,070
If you line it up just right, ah!

134
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,090
Put it on just like that.

135
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,440
Ow, aw, dang it.

136
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,663
I stabbed my thumb.

137
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:55,350
I'm good, fine.

138
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:57,723
24 pin power connector, just like that.

139
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,110
You can see, instead of an
eight pin power connector

140
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,943
on this board

141
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:01,776
we've got just a four pin.

142
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,257
So we're gonna split apart
our eight pin power connector

143
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:06,270
and just pop half of it into there.

144
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,720
This is crazy.

145
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,280
Like, if I was actually
trying to speed build this

146
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,670
I think I could do it
in under five minutes.

147
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:17,670
Now for the piece de la
resistance, our Zotac GT 210.

148
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,800
This was a slow graphics card

149
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,570
when I was still working at NCIX.

150
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,240
That was like, eight years ago.

151
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,380
You can still buy them.

152
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,668
I don't even get it.

153
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:29,590
- [David] Why?

154
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,770
- People who buy a card like this

155
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,190
don't care about performance at all,

156
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:36,640
or they get kind of screwed into it

157
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,250
because they don't know that
the performance of a $50 card

158
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,470
is not half of the
performance of a $100 card.

159
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,950
I remember talking to
Zotac about these cards

160
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,210
back when I was working at NCIX.

161
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,990
I was like, well who the
crap is buying these things?

162
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,380
They're like, oh, well Best
Buy is moving through them

163
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,213
by the truckload.

164
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:53,503
And I was like, well who...

165
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,720
Why are their salespeople
selling this to them?

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,950
It's a terrible value!

167
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,070
Point of clarification,
this is $40 US, not $50,

168
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,260
and it's still a bad deal.

169
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,450
Yeah, for a $35 US case, I'm liking it.

170
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,870
Crazily enough, that was it.

171
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,240
By the way, the keen-eyed among you

172
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,230
might've noticed that
we had an ATI Radeon fan

173
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:17,060
installed on that graphics card.

174
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,170
That's 'cause we weren't
gonna go out and buy

175
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:21,460
another GT 210 just to make this video.

176
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,940
It's one that we already had,

177
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,980
and it's one that the fan
failed on a long time ago

178
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,710
and we just kinda threw whatever on there,

179
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,590
as long as it runs cool enough.

180
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,633
Time to fire it up.

181
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,240
Ah, I miss little whiny GPU fans.

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,713
Hope it works.

183
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,510
That took a hot minute to POST, didn't it?

184
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:42,110
Let's fire up some CS GO, shall we?

185
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,870
And while we wait for the game to load

186
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,990
'cause that'll probably take a minute

187
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,949
on the mechanical drive,

188
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:49,190
we're gonna go ahead and pull out

189
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,103
our better-value gaming PC here.

190
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,050
Our slowest PC came in at a
price of just over $300 US,

191
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,090
while our step up model
came in at just under $600,

192
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,970
which is a pretty substantial increase.

193
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,710
We are spending almost twice as much.

194
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,530
But we're also getting more
than twice as much computer.

195
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:16,540
So we're going all the
way up to a Ryzen 3100,

196
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:19,510
which happens to be based
on their Zen 2 architecture.

197
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,340
That is gonna be a big
performance boost for gaming.

198
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,780
We managed to double our RAM,

199
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,400
going from four to eight gigs,

200
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,000
which also means now it's
running in dual channel mode.

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,830
We've got a more feature-rich motherboard.

202
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,290
And a big amount of our budget

203
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,340
was spent on this puppy right here.

204
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,950
So we've gone with an RX570,

205
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,825
which is maybe last-gen at this point,

206
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:44,060
but still a very, very
respectable budget gaming card

207
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,700
if we're running at 1080p.

208
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,022
Already just how much faster
it boots up and launches games

209
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:51,940
is a huge difference for this one.

210
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,410
But of course, that's what happens

211
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,030
when you spend a little
bit of extra on an SSD.

212
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,820
And the funny thing about an SSD

213
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,360
is that these days it doesn't
actually cost that much extra.

214
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,390
If you look for the right deal,

215
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,310
we got our FATTYDOVE
Racing 120 gig SSD for $20.

216
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:10,550
8X antialiasing ain't happening.

217
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's see if that helps a little bit.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,250
Gonna set the settings over here the same.

219
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,363
Oh man, this one defaulted to 4K.

220
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,333
Oh, Lordy!

221
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,253
Why?

222
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,050
Is that still loading?

223
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,700
Holy crap.

224
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,077
150, 60, 70.

225
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:30,013
200 FPS.

226
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,849
Yep.

227
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:36,780
This feels pretty good.

228
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
All right.

229
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,270
This one's loaded up now.

230
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,460
Let's just make sure
the resolutions' right.

231
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,240
And this, kids, is why
friends don't let friends

232
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,503
buy entry-level graphics cards.

233
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,970
We are getting 10 FPS,

234
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,480
my ladies and gentlemans.

235
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,820
We're charging in, though.

236
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,720
We're charging in!

237
00:09:57,884 --> 00:09:59,713
We might hit something!

238
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,917
I got one! (laughs)

239
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,653
10 FPS gaming, ladies and gentlemen.

240
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,800
Oh, come on!

241
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,920
Bot Fred's got it out for me.

242
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,410
So the lesson we're learning here

243
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,100
is that spending twice as much

244
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,750
can yield more than just twice
the performance improvement.

245
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,610
In this case we're looking at about

246
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:26,480
anywhere from 15X to 20X the performance

247
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,780
at the same settings.

248
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,140
And I actually missed another thing

249
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,420
that is twice as fast about
our higher-end system.

250
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,710
It's got USB 3 10 gig instead of five gig,

251
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:38,100
so if you really wanted
to transfer things quickly

252
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,570
over USB, you could do that.

253
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,243
Oh no, there's a first-time
setup on this one.

254
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,090
While we wait for that
one to complete setup,

255
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,330
we can go ahead and have a look

256
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,690
at what our Rocket League
performance is like.

257
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,450
Yes, I'm playing with
a mouse and keyboard.

258
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,823
I'm sorry.

259
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:55,180
(vocalizing)

260
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,760
Oh, I pressed jump instead of go fast.

261
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,000
Well, that's a shame.

262
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,233
Okay.

263
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,066
So what are we looking at?

264
00:11:01,066 --> 00:11:03,860
We're looking at 100 plus
FPS with a minimum of 48

265
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,710
the entire time we've been playing here.

266
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,910
And that minimum is
honestly more important

267
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,510
to the gamine experience
than that average is.

268
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,343
Rocket League.

269
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,520
Is this game just not even gonna launch?

270
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,980
Nope.
(laughing)

271
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,370
New plan, just for the sake
of giving our slowest PC

272
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,270
its best possible shot,

273
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,790
we actually ripped the graphics card

274
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,860
that wasn't letting us launch the game out

275
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,130
and we are running off
of the onboard graphics.

276
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,850
The problem with that is we're running

277
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,330
a single stick of memory

278
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,050
because it's a bit of a
misconfigured machine.

279
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:37,670
And now our APU graphics

280
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,850
has to share memory
bandwidth with the CPU,

281
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:43,850
which was already half of
what it ideally would be.

282
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:46,913
15 FPS in the menu.

283
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:48,657
(laughing)

284
00:11:48,657 --> 00:11:49,490
- Big oof, Linus.

285
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,850
- That's the same
settings as the other one.

286
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,080
Oh boy.

287
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,590
You know, having the game
run in slow motion like this

288
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,160
is actually kinda nice,

289
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,580
because it's not an online match

290
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,563
so I think the game is
actually running slow.

291
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,520
Finally, let's go for a good old-fashioned

292
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,970
Cinebench drag race.

293
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,410
Are you gonna, are you even trying?

294
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,510
Maybe it didn't register.

295
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,650
And one, two, three, go.

296
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,210
I think we've all seen enough,

297
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,100
and I think we've all learned the lesson

298
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,570
that we're trying to teach here.

299
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,800
Just because something is
brand new off the shelf

300
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,630
doesn't mean that it is a viable option

301
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,410
for building a system.

302
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,610
And you might say, well look,

303
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,890
I've only got $50 to spend on a CPU.

304
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,830
And that's fine.

305
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,330
And that's fair.

306
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,840
But your best option at that point

307
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,060
is to go back and look for something

308
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,350
on the secondhand market

309
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,060
that is gonna give you a
better experience than this.

310
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Literally a fraction of the
speed of even a value chip

311
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,546
like the Ryzen 3 3100,

312
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:55,130
which is really a fantastic
CPU for the money.

313
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,490
The other thing is graphics.

314
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,630
You know how there's a
point of diminishing returns

315
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,920
when you go into the very high end stuff?

316
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,620
Well there's a point
of diminishing returns

317
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,540
at the low end as well,

318
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,530
and it's something people
don't really think about.

319
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,010
So I would give the same advice there.

320
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,570
In fact, I don't want
you to get discouraged

321
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,280
if you've only got $300 to
spend on a new computer.

322
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,560
What I want you to do is
head down to the comments

323
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,850
where some of our savvy
bargain-hunter viewers

324
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,990
are gonna post some great spec lists

325
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,470
that they think they can
put together for $300,

326
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,430
'cause I guarantee if you
hit up eBay, Craigslist,

327
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,523
and all those kinds of
places, it can be done.

328
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,070
Now for the portion of this video

329
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,860
that is sponsored by LastPass.

330
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,690
LastPass is the password
manager that I use.

331
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,090
And honestly, whether
it's for personal use

332
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,170
or for our corporate use,
I absolutely love it.

333
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:44,300
The corporate version
has all kinds of tools

334
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,410
that we can use to manage access

335
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,830
to all the different accounts.

336
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,970
And not just accounts,

337
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:52,270
but little notes or credit card numbers

338
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,900
or anything else that our
staff needs access to,

339
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,940
no matter where they are,
and to do it securely.

340
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,820
And then for personal
use, well, it's great.

341
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,910
Whether I'm using a PC, an
Android phone, or an iPhone,

342
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,890
all I've gotta do is enter one password

343
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,930
and everything that I need
is right at my fingertips.

344
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,950
I'm gonna just check and see
if there's any talking points

345
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,529
that I'm supposed,

346
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:15,290
I'm just talking about what I
like about LastPass right now.

347
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,940
Oh yeah, it's way more secure

348
00:14:17,952 --> 00:14:18,867
because that way,

349
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:21,810
you only have to remember one
really strong pass phrase,

350
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,860
and you never have to
use duplicate passwords.

351
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,350
Because let's face it, who can remember

352
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,440
all the literally hundreds of passwords

353
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,900
that you have to have these days?

354
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,610
LastPass auto-fills your credentials

355
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,910
through browser extensions
or apps on mobile.

356
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,210
And if you go to LastPass Premium,

357
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,390
they've got advanced features

358
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,140
like multi-factor authentication options

359
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,280
and emergency access.

360
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,130
So go check them out at the
link in the video description.

361
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,660
I've been using them for
years, I've been super happy.

362
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,360
Thanks LastPass for being awesome.

363
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,280
And thanks LastPass for
sponsoring this video.

364
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,200
If you guys enjoy this sort of thing

365
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,710
and you're looking to
go a little bit deeper

366
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,950
than the comments on this video

367
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,750
to build a great value gaming rig,

368
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:00,590
maybe check out our, This Is a Gaming Rig?

369
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,240
Where we converted a Dell Optiplex

370
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,953
into a very viable gaming solution.
